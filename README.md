# MachineLearningRegression
Notebook for the Machine Learning: Regression PyData Fort Wayne Meetup.

This notebook uses a couple of packages that are not included in Anaconda by default. The first is `pydotplus`, which can be installed from conda:

`conda install pydotplus`

The second is GraphViz, which can be installed from Homebrew on a mac using:

`brew install graphviz`

If you are using Windows, the executables can be downloaded from [here](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/)
